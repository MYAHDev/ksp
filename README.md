#MYAH KSP Persistant save

##Install

1. Open a command shell
2. cd to your KSP/saves folder
3. In this folder run: ```git clone https://github.com/MYAHDev/ksp.git .```

This will copy the repository into the current directory (your saves folder).

######You must make sure to tell the game (when resuming a save) to ignore any bad folders it might find. A .gitignore is coming.
